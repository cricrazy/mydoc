[1.]  Make sure your system has a temporary Internet connection to download all the necessary files.



[2.]  Open a Terminal program.



[3.]  Make sure your system is up-to-date.

$ sudo apt update

$ sudo apt upgrade

$ sudo reboot

[ Note:  Reboot may be needed if the kernel has been updated/upgraded.  This step is totally optional.  You don't have to do it but it is highly recommended. ]



[4.]  Once back to the desktop, open a Terminal program again.



[5.]  Make sure you have all the necessary files (headers, gcc compiler, make utility, etc.) to compile and install the driver.

$ sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r)

$ sudo apt install build-essential dkms git



[6.]  Clone the open source driver from GitHub repository.

$ git clone https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8812au.git


[ Note:  Right after 'rt' is a letter 'l' (like lemon), not a number '1' (like 1980).  And right after 88 is a number '1' (like 1980), not a letter 'l' (like lemon).  Typing them wrong will cause GitHub to prompt you inputting a Username and a Password or saying repository not found. ]



[7.]  Change directory.

$ cd rtl8812au/



[8.]  Compile and install the driver.  There are two ways: using dkms as mentioned on the GitHub repository page or manually.  Please use either (a.) or (b.) but not both!



(a.)  Using dkms(dynamic kernel module support) which will automatically rebuild and install on kernel updates.

$ sudo ./dkms-install.sh



(b.)  Manually.

$ make

$ sudo make install



[9.]  Restart your system for the new driver to take effect.

$ sudo reboot
