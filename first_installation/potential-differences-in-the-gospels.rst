WHY DO GOSPELS DIFFER IN THEIR CONTENTS?
========================================

SCENARIO 1
----------
The Computer Science professor gives an coding project for a mid term exam. The assignment is not a straight forward. The students have to do lot of work and come up with the algorithm. They have been given a project plan and potential flow chart. There are four friends who have taken this course, they often do study together. They all work on the project separately. Just before they meet and discuss their home works. What they realize is that they all have a different viewpoint and logic for the project. They all have done their best to be true to the project objective and outputs. 

	NOW, WHAT WOULD THEY DO?
    ------------------------ 
	First Solution: They compare their homeworks, they remove the different viewpoints, and essentially get rid of all minute details. In nutshell, they destroy three of the homeworks, and pick the best of the assignments. This is what they all submit to the professor. 


    Second solution: They realize that even though, they had different logic and viewpoints, they all are able to fulfil the main objective of the assignment. They are confident, that the professor would be able to judge their work and would consider all their work as legitimate work. They all submit their respective homeworks to the professor.
	
	WHAT WOULD THE PROFESSOR DO WHEN THEY RECEIVE HOME WORK?
    -------------------------------------------------------- 
    First solution: Professor would definitely think that this is a case of plagarism. He would know that four friends have modified their work. 
	
	Second solution: Professor would accept their work, since they all successfully able to finish the assignment in their own ways. The so-called differences are actually proof that they all have been true to their work.
