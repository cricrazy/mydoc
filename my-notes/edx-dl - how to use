- edx-dl works from python. 

here is how to get the list of courses

go to c:\users\desktop\youtube-dl\edx-dl\edx-dl folder

python edx-dl -u username --list-courses

then python edx-dl.py -u username -p password -i course-URL

-i -> ignore the errors. It may skip some videos, but should download most.
