PEOPLE ARE BASICALLY GOOD.
==========================

we don't trust people around our neighborhood.
  we have 
  locks for our homes, cars, anything valuable
  lockers
  guns, AR-15
  security cameras
  gated communities
  security guards
  neighborhood watch
  fences, walls, dogs

we don't trust with our devices, online.
  we have
  passwords, if they are not enough
  two step security authentications
  vpn
  finger print scans, face ids
  antivirus
  antispyware
  identity theft security
  
we don't trust people within our cities.
  we have
  police (tear gas, pepper sprays, tasers)
  security guards
  courts
  judges
  jails
  
we don't trust nations.
  we have
  weapons, war ships, planes, even nuclear weapons
  armies
  bases
  spies
  terrorism
  wars
  Walls!
  
heck! we don't even trust aliens (in the movies/novels)

  wars, destructions and colonizations
  
  
But Hey, PEOPLE ARE BASICALLY GOOD. 
===================================
  
Doesn't  it  sound  like a  fairy  tale.
What  is  easy  to believe  that  people
are basically  good. Or to  believe that
People are NOT basically good, they have
capacity  to  do  GREAT GOOD,  but  also
capacity to do GREAT EVIL and HARM.
