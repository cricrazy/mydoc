THIS CREATES 7Z FILE FOR EVERY CSV FILE AND DELETES ORIGINAL
============================================================

FOR %i IN (*.csv) do C:\Users\chrisa\Documents\Apps\7za_cmd\7za.exe a "%~ni.7z" "%i" -sdel

%i - variable that holds the filename for each step in the FOR loop
(*.csv) - selection criteria
C:\Users\chrisa\Documents\Apps\7za_cmd\7za.exe - 7za path
"%~ni" - expands the %i variable to just the filename without extension
-sdel - deletes the original file after archiving

THIS CREATES 7Z FILE FOR EVERY FOLDER AND DELETES ORIGINAL
==========================================================

FOR /F "usebackq delims=?" %i In (`DIR /B /A:D`) Do C:\Users\chrisa\Documents\Apps\7za_cmd\7za.exe a "%i.7z" "%i" -sdel

/F tells FOR to iterate over the expanded value in ()
usebackq tells FOR that I am going to pass a command and use the output to iterate
delims=? tells FOR that I want to break tokens apart on the ? - an illegal character in file names and directories. I only want one token.
The /B in DIR is for bare format - just the name
The /A:D in DIR is for restricting the results by attribute, the D is for directories
