find . -type f | sed -rn 's|.*/[^/]+\.([^/.]+)$|\1|p' | sort -u


find . -type f -> finds all files
's -> search and replaces
| -> is a separator here (similar to /)
.*/ -> find the whole path and last filename and extension
[^/] -> makes sure it escapes any /
() -> accounts for extension only using \1 in substitution
p -> print only
sort -u -> the output is piped to sorted list
